c78 = C language publsihed in 1978 with possible new features (just changining the compilier so certain compilers can compilile certain c publihsings)
header files, declerations of the functions that are part of the main file.
the reason that header files are needed is to show that you are using the function in the file correctly,e.g.
```
#include "stdio.h"
printf("sdadada");

```
chars are translated from the ascci table, i.e x = 120 in the assci table ergo, we can add char with numbers.
char(x){
    assci(x);
    
}
