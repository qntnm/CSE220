linked list is a struct possibly that has 2 values, some data and the pointer to the next node. In the stack, the pointers of the nodes are not coninous could go from 0x0 to 0x8.
a struct with an int and a pointer is 12 bytes. 4 for the int and usally 8 for the pointer.
to check if a list is empty head = null, if it has 1 element it has a head but tail is the same as head.
